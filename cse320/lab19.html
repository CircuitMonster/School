<h1>Note 1</h1>
<br>
	In the potion program its very entertaining to see what the program really does. it takes in a set data to represent poison, wine, forward, back. it test each line to see if it is what it thinks it is. if its not then it is what it failed on and then contines; if that makes sense. So as the program goes through each line if the line is note what its tested for then it will be a select solution. other wise if the line is what it tested it wouldnt be then it is that item. in the end the solution to move forward is the 3rd bottle.

 <h1>Note 2</h1>
<br>
	In the crptarth program, the program is taking in the letters and giving them numeric values. the program then goes through the process to get the sum of the numbers of each word and then display it. Its pretty cool how it can do the arithmetic by assigning not only numbers but letters as well.

<h1>Note 3</h1>
<br>
	In the logic puzzle program it goes through many different test to see if the persons first name corresponds to the age and last name. It does this by finding one true fact about the first name and if it passes the test then it keeps eliminating the false solutions until it has the correct one.

<h1>Note 4</h1>
<br>
	In the sample4 program it does the same thing as the sample1 program but in the code there are blank spots left for the program to test to fill in. This is very cool and interesting because the program has to go through the test multiple times and find the right solution with what it actually has given to it. There are some results/test that have more or less blank spots then the others which helps it find the correst solutions.

<h1>Note 5</h1>
<br>
	In the 4th program it does some very simple math solutions. the interesting thing about this program though, is that it has labled the power of a number as a word, or as an functor. Within the () you have any number which will be the item that gets powered to what the functor is set as and then an item which will hold the value, in this case F. I found this interesting because although its simple its cool to see how the numbers are generated within the format and how the functor can be set as an equation.
