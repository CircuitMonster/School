 <h1>08a.cpp</h1>
<br>
	In the file 08a.cpp the program just runs the code from left to right as normal but it runs the signs with a priority. Multiplication and division have priority over addition and subtraction, while still being read from left to right. So what I changed was i put the two eqautions being divided in parentheses to eleiminate any confusion.
<br>

 <h1>08b.cpp</h1> 
<br>
	In the file 08b.cpp I left it unchanged. What the program is doing is it first takes in the char value of a and then adds on the ascii value to it to grab the char of that new value, which grabs "a and b". the last value it grabs which is actaully the ascii value of the letter is displayed because it is not being expressed as a char value, but rather a numeric value because of the addition.
<br>
 <h1>08c.cpp</h1>
<br>
	In the File 08c.cpp all i changed was that the user should enter in a value for "i" and "j". Other then that the program will read in the value given for i and j and then display "i" if the value of i is greater then j, or "j" if the value of j is greater then i. again this is determined by using the ascii values for the letters.
<br>
 <h1>08d.cpp</h1>
<br>
	In the File 08d.cpp I left the file the same. What the program is doign is using the bit file operators to determine what the value is. not only is the program runing the addition and multiplcation but its grabbing the values and comparing them in bit format (binary numbers).
