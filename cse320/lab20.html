 <h1>Note</h1>

	I created a program and will define the values quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies; which will then take in info from the user and tell them if it equals 100 or a dollar. This will also tell them if the amount equals a dollar. I was able to get it to tell me how many Pennies/nickles/dimes/quarters it would need but only from the smallest form no a mix of multiple coins.
