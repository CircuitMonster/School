	These programs show how functions can be influenced by the expressions within them depending on how those expressions are represented. When it comes to pointers, pointers can change how the function reads and executes what is being read in and out. "*" is going to represent pointing to an address, while "&" represents calling by reference. While pointing to the address it will always read it out and can influence it as well. When callign by reference it's possible to call the function and manipulate it without having to re write everything.
