 <h1>note</h1>
The problem with todays lab was to create the functions that were needed to be able to add and take out values within a vector. In c++ when using a vector to bring in values you use the pop_back and push_back in the functions. When using these its important to keep in mind that pop_back will delete the top value and the push_back will add a value to the top. so when running this through 0-5, it will count down like 5, 4 , 3 , 2 , 1. Its also important to keep in mind that all these fucntions where writen within the class interface as well. To solve the problem i just used the push_back, pop_back, back, and empty to solve what needed to be done. It was also important to have in the private section the vector declared in the scope of the class.
