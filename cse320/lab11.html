 <h1>Strings</h1>
	strings will take in any text typed as long as it has "". any type of character besides a number typed in without "" will give an error. '' can be used as well, but when using '' everything comes out capitalized.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Arithmetic expressions</h1>
	When doing simple equations with numbers, everything must be in (). The sign being used between the numbers must come first followed by a space and then each number that that sign is being applied to. a negative number can still be used but it must be after the starting sign and with the number it goes to with no spaces.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Constant lists</h1>
	"quote" can also display a value, but it must be in (). quote must be the first thing followed by a space, everything after that will de displayed out but in capitalization.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Variables are atoms bound to values</h1>
	it is possible to set values to a global variable by using the "setq." This is create a value to whatever function you name it as. This value will stay through out since it is set as a global value.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Arithmetic Expressions</h1>
	you can set up different equations to be solved by setting up each on within (). it will then follow the order from the inside out to solve. Trace can be used to wrtie something in, while untrace can undo what was traced in, and eliminate it until its traced in again.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Functions of lists</h1> 
	with the CAR and CDR its important to note that CAR grabs the first value of the dotted pair, while CDR grabs the second value. This stays true even when using it with cons in the ().
<br>
<br>
<h1>Variables and lists</h1>
	when using setq you can later combine them both in an order that is written within (). the interesting thing is that CAR and CDR can be combined as CADR and then CADDR to then display out the first, second, and third value.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Structure of a list of elements</h1>
	When using () within (), when its finally at its nil it will then display then in order from the furthest out () to the furtherest within.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Construct new lists from old</h1>
	When you have multiple setq's it is possible to call them all in a certain order by using append. After calling append you can then list in whatever order you want that setq to display out as.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Constructing lists with back-quotations</h1>
	When using the ` it will still read out everything that is typed within the (), but everything that is after the , within the () it will display out the value of whatever was called before in the ().
