 <h1>Note</h1>
	Using the thirdaplet code, it promotes a box that gives a message and then will have an option to chose a response. Depnding on what button is pressed will display a different color and a different phrase to your chosen response. This is done by doing a loop to see what button was pressed and then displaying what is called by which button was chosen. In this applet I chnaged the colors to refelct better the choices that were chosen and a better phrase and responce. i also added in another button for more options.

	Throwable class is the "superclass" of all errors and exceptions in Java. They are thrown by the Java Virtual machine, or by the throw statement. Two subclasses are error and exception, which are used to indicate the exceptional situations have occured. A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the time is was created. One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction; or the method to throws it must confor, tp a gerneral purpsose interface that does not permit the mehtod to throw the cause directly.
