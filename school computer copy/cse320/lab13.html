 <h1>Note</h1>
	In the lisp program for solving the maximum and the minimum numbers in a set list, the program first definds the the list as a name, and takes in the list for that name. The program then will use CAR and CDR to grab what numbers are the min and max compared to eachother by using conditions. When using these CAR and CDR its only calling two values in the list at a time and the condition compares them. It will then contine to compare them until it finishes going through the list and call the min and the max in the set list. When it compares it one item is the min/max it will assign it as nul and drop it from the comparison. It will continue to use the available numbers until everything has been sorted through.
