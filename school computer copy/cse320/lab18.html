<h1>Note 4</h1>

	In the Chem program its cool how you can call certin things that you want to see within the data and it will display everything that is assigned that that item. Its even cooler how you can call an item from that data but also only call specific information within that item to be called. Where in this program and example would have been where you only grabbed the symbol and number of the element boron.
