<h1>Scopes in C++</h1>

 <body>

In C++ scopes can manipulate variables within different ways. When a variable is initialzed gloabaly, that variable is then set at that value throughout the program unless it is manipulated within a block. Throughout the block that the variable is being manipulated it will stay at what it is initialized as until it is either manipulated again, or until it leaves outside of the block. Going into another inner block it can then be manipulated again throughout that block, but once it leaves that block it will go to what its value was declared as before either in the previous block or globally.
